# FCC_Cat_and_Dog_ImageClassifier
As a part of freeCodeCamp's Machine Learning with Python curriculam, this projected was developed to classify images of Cats & Dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network. This project also shows how to increase the training dataset with ImageDataGenerator by augmenting the trianing images through zooming, shifting and flipping. On the whole this project fimilizes the usage of Neural Networks.

This is the sample output:
